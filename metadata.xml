    <description>Esau becomes friendly when in a room with no enemies.

Mod config menu and additional functionality included!


This mod allows you to:
[list]
	[*]Tweak how Esau behaves in hostile rooms. This includes:
		[list]
		 	[*]Buddy (Friendly) mode
			[*]Ally (Helpful) mode with custom AI
			[*]Annoying (Dark side) mode, where Esau deals less damage to enemies and still attacks you
		[/list]
	[*]Turn on invulnerability to Esau while in ghost form
	[*]Make Esau not charge you when friendly (took the most time to implement tbh :D)
[/list]

Notes:

I have only tested this with [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2498592925&amp;searchtext=Dark+Shesau] Dark Shesau [/url] mod enabled

All features but Ghost form immunity and Charmed mode are sorta buggy. Bugs include: Esau disappearing when leaving room, Esau being harmless to Jacob when he should not, Esau spawning in the starting room of Basement II onwards immediately.

Here is [url=https://github.com/jiftoo/empty-room-esau]project's Github[/url] because why not.</description>
