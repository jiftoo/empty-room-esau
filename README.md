# Esau becomes friendly when in a room with no enemies.

### Available on Steam: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2524878247


Mod config menu and additional functionality included!


This mod allows you to:
- Tweak how Esau behaves in hostile rooms. This includes:
  - Buddy (Friendly) mode
  - Ally (Helpful) mode with custom AI
  - Annoying (Dark side) mode, where Esau deals less damage to enemies and still attacks you
- Turn on invulnerability to Esau while in ghost form
- Make Esau not charge you when friendly (took the most time to implement tbh :D)

Notes:

I have only tested this with [Dark Shesau](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2498592925&searchtext=Dark+Shesau) mod enabled

All features but Ghost form immunity and Charmed mode are sorta buggy. Bugs include: Esau disappearing when leaving room, Esau being harmless to Jacob when he should not, Esau spawning in the starting room of Basement II onwards immediately.
